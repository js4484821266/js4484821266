# Yezu Yi (이예주)
**Junior Python Developer — Prototyping / Automation / Data Handling**

I build small but working prototypes and practical automation tools with **Python**.
I also enjoy diving into **C/C++ internals**.

- Focus: Python prototyping, practical automation, lightweight apps (Streamlit/FastAPI)
- Now: Refreshing SQL/Pandas through mini projects (ramp up fast with references)
- Goal: Join a team with solid onboarding, code review, and documentation culture
