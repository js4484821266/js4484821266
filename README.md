# Yezu Yi (이예주)

I build **small but working prototypes** and practical automation tools with **Python**.
I also enjoy diving into **C/C++ internals**.

- **Focus:** Python prototyping, practical data handling/automation, lightweight apps (Streamlit/FastAPI)
- **Current status:** Refreshing SQL/Pandas as needed (I ramp up fast with references)
- **Goal:** Join a team with solid onboarding, code review, and documentation culture

## 🔥 Featured Projects

### 1) Voicebot — Streamlit Demo App
A working prototype that turns an idea into a runnable demo.
- Repo: https://github.com/js4484821266/voicebot
- Live demo: https://ozer-koli-ishi.streamlit.app/
- Highlights:
  - End-to-end runnable flow (input → processing → response)
  - Built for quick iteration & feedback
  - Designed to be easy to run locally (documented setup)

### 2) ZZQQCC — Big Integer Playground in C++
**Purely curiosity-driven.** A personal experiment to work with integers **beyond 64-bit** in C++.
- Repo: https://github.com/js4484821266/ZZQQCC
- What I explore here:
  - Big-integer representation design (digits/blocks)
  - Core operations (e.g., add/sub/mul/div) and edge cases
  - Performance vs. correctness trade-offs

> Note: This is a learning playground, not a production-ready library.
